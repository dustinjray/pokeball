# Product Landing Page

## Inspiration
This started as a FreeCodeCamp project to make a landing page, but I couldn't come up with images for a fake product to make a page for, so I ended up doing a (mostly) visual copy of The Wand Company's Pokéball Replica page. I did use the inspector to help determine some margins and break points.
