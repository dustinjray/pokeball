This started as the FreeCodeCamp landing page project, but it morphed into copying the landing page of The Wand Company's Pok√©ball replica, which I found to be a better learning experience.

This was mostly a visual copy, though I did use the inspector to determine some margins and breakpoints. 

The original webpage may be found here: https://www.thewandcompany.com/pokeball/
